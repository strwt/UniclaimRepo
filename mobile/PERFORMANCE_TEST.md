# Performance Test Guide - Background Component Fix

## What We Fixed

**Problem**: Continuous debug logging and background processing when in chat
- Ticket component was running continuously even when not visible
- Firebase listeners were always active, wasting resources
- Debug logs appeared every few seconds

**Solution**: Tab-based component lifecycle management
- Components only render when their tab is active
- Firebase listeners pause when tab is not focused
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

## How to Test

### 1. **Start the App**
```bash
npx expo start
```

### 2. **Navigate to Chat**
- Go to any post and start a conversation
- Navigate to the Chat screen

### 3. **Check Debug Logs**
**Before Fix**: You would see continuous logs like:
```
LOG  üîç [DEBUG] Ticket Component: {...}
LOG  üîç [DEBUG] Ticket Filtered Posts: {...}
LOG  üîç [DEBUG] useUserPostsWithSet: Hook created with email: ...
```

**After Fix**: These logs should STOP when you're in chat

### 4. **Performance Indicators**
- **Chat should be faster** - No background processing
- **Battery usage should improve** - Fewer active listeners
- **Memory usage should be lower** - Better cleanup

## What to Look For

‚úÖ **Debug Logs Stop**: No more continuous console spam  
‚úÖ **Chat Performance**: Faster, smoother chat experience  
‚úÖ **Tab Switching**: Smooth transitions between tabs  
‚úÖ **Resource Usage**: Lower CPU and memory usage  

## Expected Results

- **In Chat**: Only chat-related logs should appear
- **In Ticket Tab**: Ticket logs should appear only when tab is active
- **Background**: No continuous processing when tabs are not visible

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Tab Focus**: Ensure useFocusEffect is working
2. **Verify Cleanup**: Check if listeners are properly unsubscribed
3. **Component Mounting**: Confirm only active tab components render

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Debug logging stops when not in Ticket tab
- ‚úÖ Chat performance improves significantly
- ‚úÖ App feels more responsive overall
- ‚úÖ No more background resource waste
